# Complete Steps Reference - Judo Framework (English)

This is the complete reference of all **VERIFIED** steps available in Judo Framework v1.3.40 in English.

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: This documentation has been verified against the framework source code. It only includes steps that actually exist and work.

**💡 Note**: All steps use the `@step()` decorator, which means they work with any keyword (Given, When, Then, And, But). This provides maximum flexibility in writing your test scenarios.

### `When I store the response as "{variable_name}"`
Stores the entire JSON response in a variable.

---

## Variables

### `Then the variable "{var1}" should equal the variable "{var2}"`
Compares that two variables have exactly the same value.

### `Then the variable "{var1}" should not equal the variable "{var2}"`
Verifies that two variables have different values.

---

## Arrays and Collections

### `Then the response should be an array`
Validates that the response is a JSON array (list).

## Important Notes

- **Variable Interpolation**: Use `{variableName}` syntax in URLs, headers, and JSON bodies.
- **.env Files**: Steps with `from env` automatically load variables from .env files.
- **JSONPath**: Use standard JSONPath syntax like `$.field.subfield` to navigate JSON structures.
- **Data Types**: The framework automatically handles conversions between strings and numbers when appropriate.
- **Automatic Logging**: When enabled, automatically saves requests/responses with timestamps and metadata.
- **Pattern Matching**: Supports Karate-style patterns like `##string`, `##number`, `##email`, etc.
- **File Formats**: Supports JSON, YAML, and CSV files for test data.
- **Verification**: This documentation has been verified against the source code v1.3.36.
